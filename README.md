## Issues
```
- Freezes on inspect
    Can be fixed by running the command "filter false" before opening inspect element

- Freezes on fullscreen
    Wait a few seconds after running the command "fullscreen true" before typing another charater to occasionally solve this issue.
    (does not occur after a refresh)

- Lag when running a command that generates a lot of text
    Can be fixed by running the command "filter false"

- Clicking sound effect spazzes out if you hold down a key
    Just don't do that. No reason to.

- Linebreaks sometimes causes horizontal scrolling
    No good way to solve this unfortunately
